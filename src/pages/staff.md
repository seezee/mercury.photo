## Chris J. “Weegee” Zähller

Photojournalist</stack-l></hgroup>

Chris studied fine art at the University of Oklahoma during the parachute pants and Studio 54 era. A notorious paparazzo, he’s often seen shoving his camera in visiting dignitaries’ mugs, without so much as a “Pardon me!”</stack-l><stack-l>

## Chris J. “Barkeep” Zähller

Mixologist</stack-l></hgroup>

Chris’s first tipple was communion wine. We’re not sure what his duties are; something to do with mixing vesper cocktails “shaken until ice cold,” concocting new recipes for grenadine, and putting up batches of pimento dram. Nevertheless, he makes for a relaxed atmosphere in our offices.</stack-l><stack-l>

## Chris J. “Hack” Zähller

Staff Writer</stack-l></hgroup>

As editor of his high school newspaper, Chris had the distinction of putting all nine issues to bed late. His hobbies include writing sestinas about impresario Peter Meaden and making editors cry.</stack-l></grid-l>
