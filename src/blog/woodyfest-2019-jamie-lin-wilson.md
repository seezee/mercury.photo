By some standards, <span class="h-card p-name">Jamie Lin Wilson</span> is a late bloomer. She was nineteen when she heard <span class="h-card p-name">Natlie Maines</span> performing a solo during a <span class="h-card p-organization">Dixie Chicks</span>[^1] concert. After she dropped a few casual remarks to her mother and a cousin she found herself unwrapping an acoustic guitar on Christmas morning.

[^1]: In 2020 the band dropped “Dixie” from their name. They are now known simply as the Chicks.

Before long she began attending open-mic performances in College Station; soon after she was co-founding <span class="h-card p-organization">The Gougers</span> (also known as <span class="h-card p-organization">The Sidehill Gougers</span>), a popular Americana combo. <time datetime="2009">Concurrently</time> Wilson formed an all-female country-folk band, <span class="h-card p-organization">The Trishas</span>. The latter outfit’s close harmonies and songwriting soon garnered a considerable fan base and invitations to play large festivals.

When The Trishas went on hiatus, Wilson embarked on her solo career, releasing <cite><a href="https://geo.music.apple.com/us/album/holidays-wedding-rings/1124484180?mt=1&app=music&at=10ldhk" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Holidays &amp; Wedding Rings</a></cite> in <time datetime="2015">2015</time> and <cite><a href="https://geo.music.apple.com/us/album/jumping-over-rocks/1435628329?mt=1&app=music&at=10ldhk" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Jumping over Rocks</a></cite> in <time datetime="2018">2018</time>.

The latter album yielded <cite class="short-work">Oklahoma Stars,</cite> co-written by Wilson and <span class="h-card p-name">Evan Felker</span> (<span class="h-card p-organization">Turnpike Troubadours</span>). Predictably, the Woodyfest audience lit up for the song. But they were already putty in Wilson's hand&NoBreak;&hairsp;&NoBreak;&mdash;&NoBreak;&hairsp;&NoBreak;her expressive voice and keen songwriting being more than sufficient to keep the audience's attention.

Of the new artists this writer saw at the 2019 festival, Wilson stood out as a favorite. Hopefully this won’t be her final appearance on the Pastures of Plenty stage.
