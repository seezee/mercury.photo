Norman musician <span class="h-card p-name">Mike Hosty</span> had provided the reception music from a plywood stage under a circus tent as the rain came down. A few hours later, he received word that Flint had died. <q>He was a singer-songwriter, through and through, and just a big personality, a big heart, and [he'd] bend over backwards to do anything for you. When any musician asks you to play at their wedding, it's one of those most important days&thinsp;&hellip;&thinsp;and it's always an honor,</q> Hosty told <cite>The Oklahoman</cite>.[^2]
