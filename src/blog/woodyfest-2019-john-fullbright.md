I always supply the <span class="h-card p-organization">Woody Guthrie Coalition</span> with three files for each image: a web-optimized version, a CMYK print-optimized version, and a greyscale version (also optimized for print).[^1] I've included a web version of the latter so you can compare the color and black-and-white images.

[^1]: The greyscale versions are not straight black-and-white conversions. They include other adjustments such as tweaking the individual color channels and additional tonal adjustments when called for.
