## Nancy Apple

<p class="drop-cap">I met “Princess of Twang” <span class="h-card p-name">Nancy Apple</span> in <time datetime="2013-07-12">2013</time>, my first year volunteering to document the Woody Guthrie Folk Festival. I had photographed her earlier in the day and happened to sit next to her at the communal dinner backstage at the Pastures of Plenty.</p>

We got to chatting and she remarked, <q>Nice shirt,</q> referring to my <span class="h-card p-organization">Ardent Records</span>[^1] logo t-shirt. She went on to tell me that she had designed the Ardent Records logo years earlier when she owned a small graphic design business in Memphis.

[^1]: The Memphis pop label was founded by John Fry in <time datetime="1959">1959</time>. From <time datetime="1972">1972</time> to <time datetime="1975">1975</time> the label's music was distributed by Stax Records. Their most famous act was <a href="https://amzn.to/3xG8zVc" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Big Star</a>, whose first two albums helped define the genre "power pop."

Apple played on every stage of the festival during the period from <time datetime="2006">2006</time> to <time datetime="2018">2018</time>. Festival-goers know her for staying up late jamming in the Days Inn motel parking lot and trading songs and stories at the campground song circles. Apple is also known for making friends wherever she goes.

Today's gallery comprises images from Apple's <time datetime="2014-07-11T11:00-5:00">2014</time> Crystal Theatre showcase and her program at the <span class="h-card p-organization">Colonial Estates Nursing Home</span>. The facility is one of two nursing homes located in Okemah, where the festival is held. Both facilities host annual community outreach by festival musicians, except in <time datetime="2020">2020</time> and <time datetime="2021">2021</time> due to <abbr>COVID-19</abbr> precautions. Apple has performed for the residents at both facilities over the years.

Appearing alongside Apple at the Crystal Theatre are <span class="h-card p-name">Terry &ldquo;<span class="p-nickname">Buffalo</span>&rdquo; Ware</span>, <span class="h-card p-name">Michael McCarty</span>, <span class="h-card p-name">Don Morris</span>, <span class="h-card p-name">Butch Morgan</span>, and <span class="h-card p-name"><abbr class="noscaps">T.
