## Lucky Hat

<div class="drop-cap">

Stop me if you've heard this one before: in <time datetime="2001">2001</time>, a schoolteacher on a large Blackfoot reservation in southern Alberta quit his job to become a folk musician. Ba-doom-pah! <span class="h-card p-name">John Wort Hannam</span>, the aforementioned blinkered optimist, spent the next ten months draining his bank account while he sat at his kitchen table writing. The ten songs he produced, all while wearing his "lucky" hat, would become his first album, <time datetime="2003">2003</time>&rsquo;s <cite>Pocket Full of Holes</cite>.
</div>

Seventeen years and multiple awards later, he's released seven records. Among the accolades are a JUNO,[^1] a Canadian Folk Music Award ("Best Album of the Year"), a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Galaxie Rising Star Award, a Kerrville Texas New Folk win, and multiple Western Canadian Music Award and Canadian Folk Music Award nominations.

[^1]: The <span class="h-card p-organization">Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences</span> presents the Juno awards ("the JUNOs") annually to Canadian musicians to recognize their artistic and technical achievements.

Hannam made his Woodyfest debut in <time datetime="2010-07">2010</time>. He returned in <time datetime="2011-07">2011</time> and <time datetime="2014-07-10T15:00:00-5:00">2014</time>. The latter performance on the Crystal Theatre stage closed with some help from festival regular <span class="h-card p-name">Radoslav “Rad” Lorković</span>.

Hannam's latest release is <time datetime="2018-09-19">2018</time>&rsquo;s <cite><a href="//amzn.to/33KRzkn" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">Acres of Elbow Room</a></cite>.
