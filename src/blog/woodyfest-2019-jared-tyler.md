## The FAA Years

<div class="drop-cap">

By his own recollection, Woodyfest regular <span class="h-card p-name">Jared Tyler Frederick</span> began his professional music career around the time he turned fourteen or fifteen (circa <time datetime="1992">1992</time> or <time datetime="1993">1993</time>).[^1] A couple of years later, the Owasso high-school student began traveling to Nashville with his then-musical mentor, <span>Michael Garrett</span>.[^2] Around this time he shortened his name to Jared Tyler, which he continues to use professionally.[^3]

Tyler's first album, which he mostly wrote or co-wrote with Garrett, was a tribute to the Future Farmers of America (<abbr>FAA</abbr>), the organization that had given him some of his earliest gigging opportunities. Tyler credits the club's emphasis on public speaking with giving him the confidence to perform his music.[^4] He produced and recorded the album, <cite>Vision of Blue, Heart of Gold</cite>, in the summer before his senior year, recruiting three fellow <abbr>FAA</abbr> members as additional singers.[^5]

## Journeyman to Musical Master

After high school, Tyler continued working in music, releasing two albums and producing, recording, and performing with the likes of <span class="h-card p-name">Emmylou Harris</span>, <span class="h-card p-name">Merle Haggard</span>, and <span class="h-card p-name">Stoney Larue</span>.

In fact, Tyler kept so busy and supporting other musical acts that the gap between his third album, <cite>Here with You</cite>, and his latest, <cite><a href="//amzn.to/310qAPN" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Dirt on Your Hands</a></cite>, was a full seven years. During that time he also appeared at Woodyfest on six separate occasions, as well as accompanying many of the other festival artists.[^6]

[^6]: Tyler performed at every Woodyfest from <time datetime="2015">2015</time> to <time datetime="2020">2020</time>. The last performance was remote due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tyler's <time datetime="2019-07-12T16:30:00-5:00">2019</time> band lineup comprised <span class="h-card p-name">Isai Mireles</span> (keyboard), <span class="h-card p-name">Seth Lee Jones</span> (guitar), <span class="h-card p-name">Paddy Ryan</span> (drums), and <span class="h-card p-name">Casey Van Beek</span> (bass).
