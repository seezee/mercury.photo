## Calument, Guthrie, Dylan

<div class="drop-cap">

As part of Woodyfest’s continuing educational outreach, author <span class="h-card p-name">Daniel Wolff</span> gave a short talk about his book <cite>Grown Up Anger: The Connected Mysteries of <span class="h-card p-name">Bob Dylan</span>, <span class="h-card p-name">Woody Guthrie</span>, and the Calumet Massacre of 1913</cite> during last year’s festival.
</div>

In alternating chapters, the book weaves biographies of the two men with the story of the Calumet Massacre. The latter was the subject of a lesser-known Guthrie song, <cite class="short-work">1913 Massacre,</cite> and tells the story of a panic that broke out at a Christmas party given for striking miners in Calumet, Michigan on Christmas Eve, <time datetime="1913">1913</time>. Eyewitnesses agree that a stranger ran in and yelled <q>Fire!</q> (there was no fire), but it’s not known who the man was or what was his motivation. In the subsequent panic, seventy-three people, including sixty-two children, were crushed to death in a pile-up near the door.

Guthrie’s song reflects the com­mon belief that the stranger was an agent or sympathizer of the mine own­ers, and that a company sympathizer held the door, located at the bot­tom of a nar­row stair­case, tightly shut.

In truth, the man’s identity is unknown and no proof has ever been found to support the idea that the panic was engineered by company sympathizers, or indeed, if any such were even present. No one knows why someone entered the space and shouted <q>Fire!</q> For this reason Wolff characterizes the incident as a mystery.

Festival regular <span class="h-card p-name">Chris Buhalis</span> provided musical examples for Wolff’s lecture. <cite>Grown Up Anger</cite> was published by <span class="h-card p-organization">Harper</span> in <time datetime="2017">2017</time> and is available from <a href="https://amzn.to/34I2TMT" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">all of the usual sources</a>.
