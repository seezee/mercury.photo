Bringing their “low-tech” PowerPoint to the Brick Street Café in <time datetime="2013-0712T15:00-5:00">2013</time>, musical duo <span class="h-card p-organization">Still on the Hill</span> had the audience in stitches. Quilting stitches, that is; the PowerPoint slides consisted of text and images on handmade quilts, displayed as storytelling aids.

Husband and wife <span class="h-card p-name p-given-name">Kelly</span> and <span class="h-card p-name">Donna Mulhollan</span> sang and told stories of their native Arkansas Ozarks, played a variety of unique and strange homemade instruments,[^1] and held up the aforementioned quilts to illustrate their tales.

[^1]: The instruments were mostly made by Ozark old-timers and each has its own story&NoBreak;&hairsp;&NoBreak;&mdash;&NoBreak;&hairsp;&NoBreak;stories which the Mulhollans shared with humor and enthusiasm.

The more animated of the two, Donna held the audience’s attention with her kinetic demeanor and piercing blue eyes: eyes that commanded: <q>Do. Not. Look. Away.</q> But that is to say Kelly is the more laid back only by comparison. The two do, indeed, possess enough energy to air-condition Texas:

<blockquote>

If we ever lose power in Northwest Arkansas, we could tap into the energy of Still on the Hill and have enough left to air condition Texas!

</footer></blockquote>

The duo have created numerous Ozark-centric documentary projects, including <time datetime="2010">2010</time>’s <cite>Ozark Project</cite> and <time datetime="2015">2015</time>’s <cite>Once a River</cite>. In <time datetime="2016">2016</time> Still on the Hill completed their documentary project <cite>Still a River</cite>, a history of the Beaver Lake watershed and the White River in Northwest Arkansas. Upon its completion the <span class="h-card p-organization">National Park Service</span> granted them ten additional programs to be performed throughout Arkansas.

<time datetime="2013-0712T15:00-5:00">2013</time> was Still on the Hill’s fourth and most recent Woodyfest performance.
