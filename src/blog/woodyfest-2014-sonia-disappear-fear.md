## SOnia disappear fear

<div class="drop-cap">

Emerging from Baltimore's folk scene in the <time datetime="1987">late 1980</time>s, <span class="h-card p-name">Sonia Rutstein</span> formed the folk-duo <span class="h-card p-organization">Disappear Fear</span> (stylized &ldquo;disappear fear&rdquo;) with her sister <span class="h-card p-name">Cindy Frank</span>.[^1]

</div>

Following her sister's departure, Rutstein released a spate of solo albums, often working with other musicians, sometimes under the name <span class="h-card p-organization">disappear fear</span>, sometimes under the moniker <span class="h-card p-organization">SONiA</span>, sometimes as <span class="h-card p-organization">SONiA and disappear fear</span>. Since the beginning, her music has treated themes of social justice, feminism, and <abbr>LGBTQIA</abbr> issues. She is the recipient of dozens of awards and prestigious nominations, including a Grammy nomination for Folk Album of the Year.

For her <time datetime="2014-07-10T20:30:00-5:00">2014</time> appearance she performed as <span class="h-card p-name p-nickname p-organization">SONiA disappear fear</span>. This was her third of five appearances at the festival. Woodyfest regular <span class="h-card p-name">Don Conoscenti</span> joined her near the end of her set.
