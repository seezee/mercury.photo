## Larry Long: American Troubadour

  <blockquote>

[Larry Long is] a true American troubado[u]r.

<footer aria-label="citation">&mdash;&NoBreak;&hairsp;&NoBreak;<cite class="full-citation"><span class="h-card p-name">Studs Terkel</span></cite>, frontispiece inscription to Larry Long’s copy of Terkel’s <cite>Hard Times: An Oral History of the Great Depression</cite>.
</footer></blockquote>

In <time datetime="1977">1977</time>, twenty-six-year-old vagabond singer <span class="h-card p-name">Larry Long</span> wrote <cite class="short-work">Pope County Blues</cite> in support of farmers fighting a high voltage power line in Minnesota. <time datetime="1978">A year later</time> he organized Tennessee farmers to form what we would now call a farmers market. Following that, Long accompanied[^1] the first “Tractorcade,” a procession of family farmers traveling to Washington,  D.C. to demonstrate for fair crop prices.[^2]

[^1]: Both musically and perambulatorily.

[^2]: <cite class="h-card p-name full-citation">Ode, Kim</cite>, <cite class="short-work"><a href="http://www.startribune.com/larry-long-a-troubadour-for-social-justice/256621471/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Larry Long: a Troubadour for Social Justice</a>,</cite> (<time datetime="2014-04025">25 April 2014</time>).

While traveling with the tractorcade, Long conducted taped audio interviews of the farmers and their families. He also documented the procession photographically. Eventually Long edited the material into a slide show, <cite>Tractorcade U.S.A.,</cite> featuring traditional and original music. <cite>Tractorcade U.S.A.</cite> proceeded to travel across the United States, and the <span class="h-card p-organization">Library of Congress</span> later added excerpts from the slide show to its collection.

## The Seeger Connection

<a href="#mn:1" id="mnref:1" class="sr-only">[See note]</a>Anyone reading this probably sees the parallels with <span class="h-card p-name"><span class="p-nickname">Woody</span> Guthrie</span>, who walked, hitchhiked, and train-hopped his way from Oklahoma to the migrant camps of California during the Dust Bowl. Along the way Guthrie wrote and played songs for his fellow climate refugees, eventually becoming a spokesperson for every down-trodden soul to walk the earth in bare feet and rags.

So of course Long would eventually meet Guthrie contemporary <span class="h-card p-name">Pete Seeger</span>, circa <time datetime="1980">1980</time>. That meeting kicked off a lifelong friendship and inspired Long to organize and oversee the Mississippi River Revival, a successful decade-long effort to clean up the eponymous waterway.

## A Lifetime of Accomplishments

<a href="#mn:2" id="mnref:2" class="sr-only">[See note]</a>Long’s <span class="foreign" lang="la">curriculum vit&aelig; </span> is lengthy and impressive. A self-titled “Road Scholar,” Long organized and performed for Seeger’s 90<sup>th</sup> and 95<sup>th</sup> birthday celebrations. In <time datetime="1993">1993</time> Larry performed in Brazil as a <span class="h-card p-organization">United States Consulate</span> cultural ambassador. In <time datetime="2000">2000</time> he traveled to South Africa through a grant from the U.S. State Department to hold a collective writing workshop with students, migrant workers and union stewards. He was inducted into the <span class="h-card p-organization">America’s Old Time Music Hall of Fame</span> in <time datetime="2014">2014</time>.

Long organized the first tribute to Woody Guthrie in Okemah in <time datetime="1988">1988</time>, eleven years before Woodyfest’s birth. Long’s song, <cite class="short-work">Okemah Waltz,</cite> is the town’s official song. Long wrote it, collectively with Okemah schoolchildren, in <time datetime="1986">1986</time>. You can hear it, along with other songs from Long’s time in Okemah, on the Flying Fish <abbr>LP</abbr> <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2Gp3Xdk" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">It Takes a Lot of People (Tribute to Woody Guthrie)</a></cite>.

There’s much more to Long’s life and career, too much for this article. We encourage you to read his <a href="//www.larrylong.org/about/press/">resum&eacute; and career highlights</a> on his website.

## Long May He Sing

Long returned to Okemah for Woodyfest 2019, his tenth time to grace her stages. He was accompanied in his late-morning performance by violinist “Fiddlin’&NoBreak;&hairsp;&NoBreak;” Pete Watercott.
