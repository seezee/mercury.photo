Although <span class="h-card p-name">Andy Adams</span> is no stranger to music,[^1] the Tahlequah native admits the title of his latest release, <cite>Back to Square One</cite>, could be taken literally. As described in an article <cite><span class="h-card p-organization">The Daily Oklahoman</span></cite>, <q><cite><a href="https://geo.music.apple.com/us/album/back-to-square-one/1293624745?mt=1&app=music&at=10ldhk" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Back to Square One</a></cite> is aptly titled and [is] the result of [&hellip;] a practical commitment to the craft, of carrying out a cohesive vision in the studio and of what it really means to make a living from songs.</q>[^2] Or as Adams puts it, <q>The whole point with the record was to do everything the way they say you’re supposed to. I wasn’t shy about asking for help and being receptive. I asked people I’ve worked with before, <q>How did you do this?</q> and <q>Can I pick your brain?</q></q>[^3]

[^1]: Adams was a frequent musical performer in the Oklahoma City metro before the spread of COVID-19 shut down most music venues. He also formerly hosted a weekly songwriter night at the Blue Door. He released the full-length <cite>Done Crossed That Line</cite> in <time datetime="2013">2013</time> and the followup EP <cite>I’ll Try Harder Next Time</cite> in <time datetime="2015">2015</time>.
