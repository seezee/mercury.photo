<span class="h-card p-name">Jacob</span> Tovar didn’t set out to be a musician. The Tulsa-based musician grew up with a deep, abiding love of classic country music, particularly from the <time datetime="1950">’50s</time> and <time datetime="1960">’60s</time>. In an interview in the <cite>Tulsa World</cite> he name-checked <span class="h-card p-name">Marty Robbins</span>, <span class="h-card p-name">Hank Thompson</span>, <span class="h-card p-name">Hank Williams</span>, and <span class="h-card p-name">Merle Haggard</span> as examples of "roots" country musicians he admires.[^1]

But when he moved from his parent’s Perry, Oklahoma[^2] farm to Tulsa in <time datetime="2009">2009</time> he found himself surrounded by like-minded musicians, including <span class="h-card p-name">Paul Benjaman</span> and Woodyfest regular <span class="h-card p-name">Jared Tyler</span>, who encouraged him to <q>get […] up on stage and […] just start doing it. I had always loved that old, classic country style, and I knew I could sing it really well and I thought, man, I’m going to start doing that.</q>[^3] <time datetime="2020">Eleven years later</time>, he has a regular Thursday night spot at famed nightspot The Colony, or at least he did until <abbr>COVID-19</abbr> shut down all the bars and restaurants.

[^2]: Tovar was born in Stillwater but grew up in Perry.

[^3]: Tovar, quoted in <span class="foreign" lang="la">ibid.</span>

Tovar’s mother imparted his melodic sense when she taught young Jacob to whistle, and his late brother inspired him to begin playing the guitar. His music borrows reverently from western swing and honky-tonk. <span class="h-card p-name">Bob Wills</span>’ spirit suffuses songs such as <cite class="short-work">Three Good Reasons</cite> and <cite class="short-work">One Track Minded Baby.</cite>[^4] Both songs may be found on Tovar’s sole release to-date, <time datetime="2014">2014</time>’s <a href="https://geo.music.apple.com/us/artist/jacob-tovar-the-saddle-tramps/1020380921?mt=1&app=music&at=10ldhk" target="_blank" rel="external noopener"><cite>Jacob Tovar and the Saddle Tramps</cite></a>.

[^4]: The latter musician was based in Tulsa, too, having uprooted his band, <span class="h-card p-organization">The Playboys</span>, from Waco, Texas, and resettled them in T-Town. That was when Wills changed the band name to <span class="h-card p-organization">The Texas Playboys</span>.

Tovar is currently working on an album with producer <span class="h-card p-name">Isaac Hanson</span> and a music video with filmmaker <span class="h-card p-name">Sterlin Harjo</span>, both to be released soon.
